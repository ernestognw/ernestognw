## Hey! I'm Ernesto 🤘

I'm a Software Engineer 👨‍💻 who have a passion for building usable and scalable products. My favorite programming language is Javascript and I really love to use/teach about GraphQL, blockchain and smart contracts.

### What I do 🪄

I'm currently working at [Zenfi](https:://zenfi.mx) and [YoTePresto.com](https://yotepresto.com), building financial health for Mexican people.

Also, I've been working at @Google during the last two summers on a Software Engineering Internship, my contributions so far go from solving bugs on Google Chrome/Chromium to create automated Terraform configurations for infra-as-code tools.

### Educational Contributions ⭐️
 - I teach how to code smart contracts, cryptographic stuff, tokens and digital identity on [Blockdemy](https://www.youtube.com/c/Blockdemy/videos)
 - I'm an editor at [Javascript In Plain English](https://javascript.plainenglish.io), and sometimes I publish some tutorials like [this one](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/writing-a-node-js-graphql-backend-that-actually-scales-a-complete-guide-part-1-setup-cddceae25bdc).
